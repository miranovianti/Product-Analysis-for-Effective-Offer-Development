**Introduction and Objectives**

The project manager responsible for the product line is requesting an analysis to determine which products belong to the primary and secondary ranges. This analysis needs to be conducted continuously throughout the project period. The analysis process involves not only qualitative research but also data-driven research. The results of this analysis will be presented to the project manager as a foundation for making more informative and strategic decisions.

The main objective of this analysis is to formulate more effective product offerings to customers by considering the sustainability of relevant secondary items and optimizing the procurement process. By focusing on identifying products in the primary and secondary ranges, this project can enhance operational efficiency and improve customer response to product offerings.
